I am a postdoctoral university assistant at the <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/en/" target="_blank">University of Vienna</a> in the <a href="https://isor.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics and Operations Research</a>. I am a member of the research group <a href="https://quarimafi.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">QUARIMAFI - Quantitative Risk Management and Mathematical Finance</a> and a project staff member of the START research project "Universal Structures in Mathematical Finance" led by <a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/christa.cuchiero/" target="_blank">Christa Cuchiero</a>.

Previously, I completed my doctorate degree in Mathematics at the University of Mannheim under the supervision of David Prömel. I received my bachelor's and master's degree in Mathematics at Heidelberg University.

Please find my <a href="home/cv.pdf" "target="_blank">CV</a> here.

I am interested in stochastic analysis, in particular pathwise stochastic calculus, rough path theory and signatures, and their applications in mathematical finance.
