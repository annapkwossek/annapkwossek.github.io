I am a postdoctoral university assistant at the University of Vienna in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research. I am a member of the research group QUARIMAFI - Quantitative Risk Management and Mathematical Finance and a project staff member of the START research project "Universal Structures in Mathematical Finance" led by Christa Cuchiero.

Previously, I completed my doctorate degree in Mathematics at the University of Mannheim under the supervision of David Prömel. I received my bachelor's and master's degree in Mathematics at Heidelberg University.

Please find my CV here.

I am interested in stochastic analysis, in particular pathwise stochastic calculus, rough path theory and signatures, and their applications in mathematical finance.
